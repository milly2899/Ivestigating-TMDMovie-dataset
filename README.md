## Conclusions
**From the TMDMovie data set**There is a correlation between deffirent variables having most of them being positive correlated.
>**limitations from tyhe correlation** TMDMovie dataset consits of many variables  not clearly stating how all the variables relates.

**From the most popular movie**in most of the years from the 1960-2015 drama is the most popular movie
>**limitation from the most popuar movie** By knowing that we can't  come to a conclusion that it acquired high profit  or the highest revenue after selling it taking for example 'the star wars ' movie is no drama genre but was the second highest in revenue adjustment yearly.

**From revenue adjustment** movie named Avatar is has the high revenue adjustment compared to other movies yearly.
>**limitation from the revenue adjustment** From the histogram we find out that Avatar had the highest revenue but doesn't guarantee that if they acquired a profit or a loss.
